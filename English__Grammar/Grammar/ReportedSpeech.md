## **Як змінюється час у Reported Speech?**  

При переході з прямої мови до непрямої **час дієслова зсувається на один крок назад** у минуле:

| **Direct Speech** | **Reported Speech** |
|------------------|------------------|
| `Present Simple` I **like** this book. | `Past Simple` She said she **liked** that book. |
| `Present Continuous` I **am reading** now. | `Past Continuous` She said she **was reading** then. |
| `Past Simple` I **bought** a car. | `Past Perfect` She said she **had bought** a car. |
| `Present Perfect` I **have seen** this movie. | `Past Perfect` She said she **had seen** that movie. |
| `Will` I **will call** you. | `Would` She said she **would call** me. |
